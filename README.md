# Gistbender

Gistbender is a web based application allowing for effortless testing and sharing of Arduino sketches directly from the browser (similar to Github's [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)). 

It is built on the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework, using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) for the database.

## Features
* Utilizes the codebender compilerflasher to provide:
  * Compilation of Arduino sketches
  * Upload to Arduino devices
